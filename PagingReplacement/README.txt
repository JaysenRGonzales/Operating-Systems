my program was written in C++ and was tested on personal machine as well as eros servers.

----------------

COMPILE:

g++ -o a4 a4.cpp
./a4  

-------------------               			

The program will then ask you to enter a frame number between 1-20
A empty frame is represented by -1.

FIFO will only display if LRU and Optimal have a tied number of page faults

I have also attached 2 photos of example results from a random generated set. 

Every time you run the program, you will get a new set of random reference strings.


if there is any confusion in my instructions,
