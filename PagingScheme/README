/*
Write a program that takes a reference string and the number
of frames as inputs to simulate page replacement algorithms. 
Suppose the maximum length of a reference string is 20 and there are 5 diffent
numbers of pages. Randomly generate a reference string, e.g. 2 1 3 4 5 2 3 ... 
Take the number of frames as an input from the user. Find out the different number of page faults 
using the Optimal and LRU algorithms.  If there is a tie, use the FIFO algorithm to break 
the tie. Print out the page replacement process and you can see how LRU differs from 
the optimal. */
